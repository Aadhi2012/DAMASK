Things to be implemented into the code

# parsing of texture data from mattex file to be done by separate "texture.f90", thus freeing constitutive.f90 from this global task
 this should go along with new scheme for multi material definition
# constitutive law to be used is indicated within [material]. constitutive.f90 then assumes a wrapper functionality for the four functions "dot_microstructure", "Lpanditstangent", "postresults" and "microstructure". Within those, a switch case checks for the true constitutive law (a string) and passes control on to the respective subroutine-clone of this law. Technically, the compilation relies on "IFDEF" to include the necessary constitutive laws plus the corresponding entries in each switch case.
# change state variable meaning to (i) homogenization, (ii) microstructure
# adopt CPFEM_GIA8.f90 to new scheme, rename to CPFEM_RGC.f90
# make OpenMP parallelization work again
