  abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Constant true strain rate simple compression tests
	were conducted on annealed, polycrystalline samples of Î±-brass and
	MP35N, and the evolution of the true stress (Ïƒ)-true strain (Îµ)
	response was documented. From these data, the strain hardening rate
	was numerically computed, normalized with shear modulus (G), and
	plotted against both (Ïƒ âˆ’ Ïƒ 0)/G (Ïƒ0 being the initial yield
	strength of the alloy) and Îµ. Such normalized plots for Î±-brass
	and MP35N were found to be almost identical to each other, and revealed
	four distinct stages of strain hardening: stage A, with a steadily
	decreasing strain hardening rate up to a true strain of about âˆ’0.08;
	stage B, with an almost constant strain hardening rate up to a true
	strain of about âˆ’0.2; stage C, with a steadily decreasing strain
	hardening rate up to a true strain of about âˆ’0.55; and a final
	stage D, again with an almost constant strain hardening rate. Optical
	microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed
	on deformed samples. The results suggested that stage A corresponded
	to stage III strain hardening (dynamic recovery) of higher stacking
	fault energy (SFE) fcc metals such as copper. The onset of stage
	B correlated with the first observation of deformation twins in the
	microstructure. Further straining in stage B was found to produce
	clusters of parallel twins in an increasing number of grains. Stage
	C correlated with the development of severe inhomogeneity of deformation
	within most grains, and with the development of significant misorientation
	between the twin/matrix interface and the {111} plane in the matrix
	of the grain, i.e., the matrix/twin interface lost coherency with
	continued deformation. Stage D correlated with extensive formation
	of secondary twins that resulted in twin intersections in many grains.
	Early in stage D, some strain localization in the form of shear bands
	was observed. Although formation of these shear bands had no detectable
	effect on the macroscopic strain hardening rate, it did correlated
	with a marked change in texture evolution. Based on these experimental
	observations, we have developed and presented a physical description
	of the microstructural phenomena responsible for the various strain
	hardening stages observed in low SFE fcc alloys.},

  abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;The digital image correlation (DIC) technique
	is successfully applied across multiple length scales through the
	generation of a suitable speckle pattern at each size scale. For
	microscale measurements, a random speckle pattern of paint is created
	with a fine point airbrush. Nanoscale displacement resolution is
	achieved with a speckle pattern formed by solution deposition of
	fluorescent silica nanoparticles. When excited, the particles fluoresce
	and form a speckle pattern that can be imaged with an optical microscope.
	Displacements are measured on the surface and on an interior plane
	of transparent polymer samples with the different speckle patterns.
	Rigid body translation calibrations and uniaxial tension experiments
	establish a surface displacement resolution of 1&nbsp;Î¼m over a
	56&nbsp;mm scale field of view for the airbrushed samples and 17&nbsp;nm
	over a 100100&nbsp;Î¼m scale field of view for samples with the fluorescent
	nanoparticle speckle. To demonstrate the capabilities of the method,
	we characterize the internal deformation fields generated around
	silica microspheres embedded in an elastomer under tensile loading.
	The DIC technique enables measurement of complex deformation fields
	with nanoscale precision over relatively large areas, making it of
	particular relevance to materials that possess multiple length scales.},

	plastic deformation parallel to the Î³-TiAl/Î±2-Ti3Al lamellar boundaries
	is controlled by the softer Î³-TiAl phase while deformation which
	contains a component normal to these boundaries is dominated by the
	harder Î±2-Ti3Al phase. The parameters appearing in the crystal-plasticity
	materials constitutive relations are assessed using the available
	experimental information pertaining to the active slip systems, their
	deformation resistances and hardening and rate behavior of the two
	constitutive phases both in their single-crystalline and in polysynthetically-twinned
	lamellar forms. The constitutive relations are implemented in a Vectorized
	User Material Subroutine (VUMAT) of the commercial finite element
	program Abaqus/Explicit within which the material state is integrated
	during loading using an explicit Euler-forward formulation. The results
	obtained suggest that the adopted crystal-plasticity model and the
	parameters assessed in the present work account quite well for the
	observed room-temperature deformation behavior of polysynthetically-twinned
	lamellar Î³-TiAl + Î±2-Ti3Al single crystals.},

	of a nano-scale random pattern having high contrast during SEM imaging,
	baseline full-field thermal deformation experiments have been performed

	a specially redesigned commercial heating plate and control system,
	with modified specimen attachment procedures to minimize unwanted
	image motions, recently developed distortion correction procedures
	were shown to be effective in removing both drift and spatial distortion
	fields under thermal heating. 2D-DIC results from heating experiments
	up to 125Â°C on an aluminum specimen indicate that (a) the fully
	corrected displacement components have nearly random variability
	and a standard deviation of 0.02&nbsp;pixels (â‰ˆ25&nbsp;nm at 200Ã—
	and â‰ˆ0.5&nbsp;nm at 10,000Ã—) in each displacement component and
	(b) the unbiased measured strain fields have a standard deviation
	â‰ˆ150â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’6 and a mean value that is in good agreement with

  abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;A metallographic study has been made of the microstructures
	produced by room temperature deformation of 0.6mm thick commercially
	pure titanium sheet metal in uniaxial, plane strain and biaxial tension.
	Deformation twinning becomes increasingly important as the deformation
	mode changes from uniaxial through plane strain to equibiaxial tension,
	and is more significant for strain transverse to the rolling direction
	than for strain in the longitudinal direction. In uniaxial tension,
	1122 twins are dominant in longitudinal straining, while 1012 twins
	dominate in transverse straining. In plane strain and equibiaxial
	straining, 1012 twinning is suppressed and largely replaced by 1122
	twinning. The observed changes in twin occurrence and type are attributed
	to the interaction of the imposed stress system and the crystallographic
	texture of the rolled sheet, which alters the distribution of the
	grain basal-plane poles with respect to the operative stress axes.
	In uniaxial tension parallel to the longitudinal direction, twins
	favored by â€˜câ€™ axis compression are produced, while in the transverse
	direction twins favored by â€˜câ€™ axis tension appear. In plane
	strain and biaxial tension the dominant stress is through-thickness
	compression, which produces twins favored by â€˜câ€™ axis compression
	in nearly all cases. The alterations in twin orientation and numbers
	are associated with changes in stress-strain behavior. As twin volume
	fraction increases and twins are aligned more closely to the principal
	stress axis, the instantaneous work-hardening rate tends to stabilize
	at a nearly constant value over a large strain range.},

	by the shear modulus (G), and plotted against both normalized stress

	three distinct stages of strain hardening that were similar to those

	play an important role. Optical microscopy and Orientation imaging

	of deformation twinning correlated with a sudden increase in strain
	hardening rate in compression tests. The falling strain hardening
	rate correlated with saturation in the twin volume fraction. In shear
	testing a much lower rate of strain hardening was found, at all strains,

	Using multiple, time-spaced images and in-plane rigid body motions

	the correction procedures successfully remove both drift and spatial
	distortions with errors on the order of ï¿½0.02&nbsp;pixels. A series
