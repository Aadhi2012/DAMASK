%\section{Introduction}
If more than one grain is simulated per integration point, a homogenization scheme is required to distribute the deformation gradient of the IP to the respective grains. The simplest choice is the \emph{isostrain approach} which simply consists in assuming the IP deformation gradient to be applicable directly to each grain.
