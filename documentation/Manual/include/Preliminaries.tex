Some hints
\begin{itemize}
  \item This manual cannot substitute proper commenting in the Fortran code. Try to include as much comments as possible directly in the code. 
  \item When commenting, do not use cryptic comments such as \emph{Random is random!} -- an actual example from the code. 
\end{itemize}
