Install MPIE modifications to use DAMASK_marc2010/11/12

Refer to http://damask.mpie.de for complete installation instructions.

Usually you will need to be root for this to work!

This is for the Linux64 version of Marc/Mentat2010(.2)/11/12.
See Marc and Mentat Release Guide for List of Build and Supported Platforms!

The Intel Fortran compiler needs to be installed. The 2010 release of Marc/Mentat relies on Intel Fortran 10.1(_18)! The 2011/2012 release of Marc/Mentat relies on Intel Fortran 12.0! Make sure that ifort (the compiler executable) is in the PATH and that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set correctly, refer to the Intel installation guide for instructions on how to do this.

The AMD Core Math Library or an other BLAS implementation (currently IMKL and LAPACK are supported) needs to be installed! 
Add acml path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, to do so either use the script setup_shellrc.py in the installstion folder or for a systemwide setup edit /etc/csh.cshrc.local and/or /etc/bash.bashrc.local.
Assuming ACML is installed in path ACMLDIR the path should read: /ACMLDIR/ifort64_mp/lib (this is the version using paralllization, ie openmp):
 for bash: LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/ACMLDIR/ifort64_mp/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 for csh:  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /ACMLDIR/ifort64_mp/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
 
As the apply_DAMASK_modifications script has to fix the path for the BLAS it needs to be installed in a place that can be accessed by all users of the system. In addition you have to specify the respective locations in DAMASK_ROOT/lib/pathInfo. 

1) Install Marc, Mentat and Documentation as usual
   Run the test example including subroutines to confirm that the installation of both Marc/Mentat and the Intel Fortran Compiler is ok!
2) Run the apply_DAMASK_modifications script from this directory.
