Install the AMD Core Math Library

1. untar the tgz file to a local directory
2. run the install script, use standard directory (/opt/acml4.4.0) for install otherwise run_marc scripts need to be adjusted
3. add acml path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, the best place to do so is: /etc/csh.cshrc.local and/or /etc/bash.bashrc.local
   path should read: /opt/acml4.4.0/ifort64_mp/lib (this is the version using paralllization, ie openmp)
