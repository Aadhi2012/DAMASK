Install MPIE modifications to use DAMASK_marc2010

Usually you will need to be root for this to work!

This is for the Linux64 version of Marc/Mentat2010(.2).
See Marc and Mentat Release Guide for List of Build and Supported Platforms!

The Intel Fortran compiler needs to be installed. The 2010 release of Marc/Mentat relies on Intel Fortran 10.1!
Make shure that ifort (the compiler executable) is in the PATH and that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set correctly,
refer to the Intel installation guide for instructions on how to do this.

The AMD Core Math Library needs to be installed in the standard path /opt/acml4.4.0,
otherwise the scripts run_marc run_h_marc and run_mp_marc need to be adopted accordingly!
Add acml path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, the best place to do so is: /etc/csh.cshrc.local and/or /etc/bash.bashrc.local
The path should read: /opt/acml4.4.0/ifort64_mp/lib (this is the version using paralllization, ie openmp):
for bash: LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/acml4.4.0/ifort64_mp/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
for csh: setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /opt/acml4.4.0/ifort64_mp/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

1) Install Marc, Mentat and Documentation as ususal
   Run the test example including subroutines to make shure the installation of both Marc/Mentat and the Fortran Comnpiler is ok!
2) Run the apply_MPIE_modifications script from this directory.
