# -free                        to use free-format FORTRAN 90 syntax
# -O <0-3>                     optimization level
# -fpp                         use FORTRAN preprocessor on source code
# -openmp                      build with openMP support
# -w90 -w95                    suppress messages about use of non-standard Fortran (previous version of abaqus_v6.env only)
# -WB                          turn a compile-time bounts check into a warning (previous version of abaqus_v6.env only)
# -mP2OPT_hpo_vec_divbyzero=F  inofficial compiler switch, proposed by abaqus but highly dubios (previous version of abaqus_v6.env only)
# -ftz                         flush underflow to zero
# -implicitnone                assume no implicit types (e.g. i for integer)
# -assume byterecl             count record length in bytes
# -real-size 64 -DFLOAT=8      assume size of real to be 8 bytes, matches our definition of pReal
# -integer-size 32 -DINT=4     assume size of integer to be 4 bytes, matches our definition of pInt

# You can compile DAMASK into a library to be used with abaqus
# it saves you from compiling the subroutine for each job
# in this case you do not have to specify a usersubroutine file
# however if you still do, the compiled version will override that in the library
# Procedure:
# 1. create a library directory, e.g. abqlib, in your prefered location
# 2. build the library replacing your_prefered_location/abqlib with the correct path to the directory created in 1.:
#    abaqus make -l DAMASK_abaqus_std.f -dir your_prefered_location/abqlib
#    abaqus make -l DAMASK_abaqus_exp.f -dir your_prefered_location/abqlib
# 3. uncomment the next line after replacing your_prefered_location/abqlib with the correct path to the directory created in 1.
# usub_lib_dir='your_prefered_location/abqlib'

# Remove the temporary names from the namespace
del fortCmd
