# You can compile DAMASK into a library to be used with abaqus
# it saves you from compiling the subroutine for each job
# in this case you do not have to specify a usersubroutine file
# however if you still do, the compiled version will override that in the library
# Procedure:
# 1. create a library directory, e.g. abqlib, in your prefered location
# 2. build the library replacing your_prefered_location/abqlib with the correct path to the directory created in 1.:
#    abaqus make -l DAMASK_abaqus_std.f -dir your_prefered_location/abqlib
#    abaqus make -l DAMASK_abaqus_exp.f -dir your_prefered_location/abqlib
# 3. uncomment the next line after replacing your_prefered_location/abqlib with the correct path to the directory created in 1.
# usub_lib_dir='your_prefered_location/abqlib'

# Remove the temporary names from the namespace
del fortCmd
